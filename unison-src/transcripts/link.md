# Linking definitions to metadata

```ucm:hide
.> builtins.mergeio
```

The `link` and `unlink` commands can be used to manage metadata linked to definitions. For example, you can link documentation to a definition:

```unison
use .builtin

coolFunction x = x * 2

coolFunction.doc = [: This is a cool function. :]
```

```ucm
.> add
.> link coolFunction.doc coolFunction
```

You can use arbitrary Unison values and link them as metadata to definitions:

```unison
toCopyrightHolder author = match author with
  Author guid name -> CopyrightHolder guid name

alice = Author (GUID Bytes.empty) "Alice Coder"

coolFunction.license = License [toCopyrightHolder alice] [Year 2020] licenses.mit

licenses.mit = LicenseType [:

:]
```

```ucm
.> add
.> link coolFunction.license coolFunction
.> link alice coolFunction
```

We can look at the links we have:

```ucm
.> links coolFunction
```

We can link the same metadata simultaneously to multiple definitions:

```unison
myLibrary.f x = x + 1
myLibrary.g x = x + 2
myLibrary.h x = x + 3
```

```ucm
.> add
.> cd myLibrary
.myLibrary> find
.myLibrary> link .alice 1-3
.myLibrary> links f
.myLibrary> links g
.myLibrary> links h
.myLibrary> history
```

Examples of user error that are handled

```unison:hide
x = 42
x.doc = [: I am the documentation for x :]
```

```ucm:hide:all
.> add
```
1. Trying to link a document that does not exist to an existing value:
```ucm:error
.> link x.do x
```

2. Trying to link two non existing values
```ucm:error
.> link blah blah
```

3. Trying to link an existing document to a non existing value:
```ucm
.> link x.doc y
```

```ucm
.> cd a.b
.> link .x.doc y
```

4. Re-linking an existing valid link:
```ucm
.> link x.doc x
.> link x.doc x
```
